## Introduction

This project is a Go (Golang) application. This README will guide you through setting up, initializing, testing, and building the project.

---

## Prerequisites

* Go installed (version 1.18 or higher recommended)
* Git (for cloning the repository)
* Make (optional, if you provide a Makefile)

Check Go installation by running:

```bash
go version
```

---

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-go-project.git
cd your-go-project
```

---

## Initialize the Project

Initialize the Go module (if not already initialized):

```bash
go mod init github.com/yourusername/your-go-project
```

Download dependencies:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

---

## Running Tests

Run all tests in the project:

```bash
go test ./...
```

To run tests with verbose output:

```bash
go test -v ./...
```

---

## Building the Project

Build the Go project executable:

```bash
go build -o your-project-name
```

This will create an executable file named `your-project-name` in the current directory.

To build for a specific OS and architecture (example: Linux amd64):

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o your-project-name-linux
```
